# Roadmap

This repository contains the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) of all features that planned for implementation in [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

In the [roadmap file](ROADMAP.md), all the goals are listed. These are features that are planned and approved for implementation by the core developers and contributors. If a feature requires broader description, an extra document can be  put inside the features folder (in a sub-folder if it intends to include images), and linked from the main file.

In the [wishlist file](WISHLIST.md), features that would be nice to have are listed. These are features that are not planned for the near or medium term, or that are simply did not get enough interest from the core contributors. The wishlist folder is available to add relevant documents to explain features in detail.


# FAQ

### Q) Why not Kanban, Trello, Issues, etc?
In open source projects, developers work on their free time and, at their own pace, and out of pure motivation. Setting goals and deadlines is not comaptible with this methodology, as things get done when they get done. Because of this, the aim of this document is to just list and discuss the ideas.
